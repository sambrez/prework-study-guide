# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This application was built for the purpose of organizing and condensing relevant study material for students of the coding bootcamp that are completeing the prework modules. Given that the prework assignments cover multiple coding languages, this Prework Study Guide Webpage helps to resolve any confusion or feelings of overwhelmingness derived from the scope and difficulty of the topics included. While the nature and goal of this entire project was to learn about the basics of coding, the most important lesson I came to understand is that mistakes are an integral and expected part of the process. This lesson reinforces the original motivation behind this projecct of making the most out of the opportunity provided by the prework modules.
